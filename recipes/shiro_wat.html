    <h1>Shiro Wat</h1>
    <img src="../images/shiro.jpg" alt="shiro wat" height="300px">
    <p>Shiro is a simple, silky ground chickpea stew that takes little time and effort to bring together. In Eritrea and Ethiopia, it’s a most beloved and important dish — a vital source of flavor and protein. In those countries, it’s made with widely available shiro powder, a mixture of ground chickpeas, garlic, onion and spices.</p>
    <p><strong>INGREDIENTS</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>shiro powder</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>⅓ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>DIRECTIONS</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>In a medium sized pot or Dutch oven, heat ⅓ cup of olive oil on low to medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add a teaspoon of minced garlic along with the tomato paste and sauté for 30 seconds until the garlic is fragrant.</li>
        <li>Now, add the shiro powder, along with salt and 3 cups of water, and bring to a boil on medium heat. Then, turn down the heat to a low to medium, and let it simmer for about 20 to 30 minutes to allow the mixture to thicken to your desired consistency. </li>
    </ul>
